# 🥇 Competition Matrix

Buddy Check exists in a landscape of apps focused on reducing screen time and digital distractions. However, it offers a unique approach compared to its competitors.

## 🔍 How Buddy Check Stands Out

While apps like **AppBlock**, **One Sec**, or **RescueTime** rely on complete blocking, passive tracking, or lockouts, **Buddy Check** focuses on **intentional behavior change** and **flexibility**. 

It is not designed to punish users, but to gently **interrupt bad habits**, prompt **reflection**, and create long-term improvements through positive feedback and user empowerment.

## 🧩 Key Differentiators

- **Air Tank System**: Encourages mindful app use instead of total bans.
- **Quiet Hours**: Blocks apps and notifications only during user-selected times.
- **Weekly Reflections**: Helps users track progress and stay motivated.
- **Settings Delay**: Prevents impulsive unblocking or overuse.
- **Cross-platform support**: Works across mobile and desktop environments.

> Buddy Check is not about taking control away from users — it's about giving them the tools to **stay in control**.
