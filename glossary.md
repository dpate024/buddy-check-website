# ðŸ“– Glossary

**Air Tanks**  
A metaphor used by Buddy Check to limit screen time. Each Air Tank represents a scrolling session, and users are given a limited number per day. Once used, the app/site is blocked until the next day.

**Breathing Breaks**  
Gentle pop-up reminders that appear after extended scrolling. They prompt users to pause, reflect, and consider ending their session.

**Buddy Check**  
The name of the app and system. Inspired by diving safety, it represents a digital check-in tool that helps users build healthier scrolling habits.

**Doomscrolling**  
The compulsive habit of continuously consuming negative news or content online, often leading to anxiety, sleep disruption, and emotional burnout.

**Impulse Behavior**  
The automatic action of opening apps or sites without conscious thought, often during idle moments or boredom.

**Mindful Scrolling**  
An intentional and reflective approach to screen use where the user is aware of their time and attention.

**Quiet Hours**  
User-defined time periods where distracting apps are blocked, and notifications are silenced, especially during sleep or focus times.

**Reflection Prompt**  
A feature in Buddy Check that encourages users to assess their screen habits weekly and set goals for improvement.

**Settings Delay**  
A feature that prevents users from impulsively changing app restrictions. Changes require time and a second confirmation to take effect.

**Screen Time Goals**  
Personal limits or objectives that users set to reduce their time spent on specific apps or categories of content.

**System Flow**  
The underlying decision logic that powers how Buddy Check enforces restrictions and interacts with the user during app usage.

**Weekly Summary**  
A feature that provides users with a report of their screen usage and prompts them to reflect on their behavior.
