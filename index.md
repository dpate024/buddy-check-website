# Buddy Check

Welcome to **Buddy Check** — a CS 410/411W project focused on reducing screen addiction through mindful app usage and user reflection.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Despite widespread awareness of the negative impacts of excessive screen use on productivity, mental health, and sleep, most people still struggle to implement lasting behavioral changes.  
The convenience and design of modern digital platforms promote **habitual doomscrolling**, making it difficult for individuals to break the cycle without external support or intentional intervention.

---

## ⚠️ Problem Characteristics

- 🤯 **Impulse Behavior** – Users open apps reflexively during idle moments.
- ⏰ **No Pauses** – Infinite scroll and autoplay eliminate natural breaks.
- 💤 **No Quiet Time** – Apps and notifications are available 24/7, disrupting rest.
- ⚙️ **Instant Changes** – Restrictions can be easily disabled during temptation.
- 📉 **Low Awareness** – Most users don’t reflect on or track their screen time.

---


## 💡 Solution Statement

**Buddy Check** is a multi-platform, behavioral tool designed to help people **build healthier screen habits** without giving up social media entirely.  
It introduces features like time-limited access ("Air Tanks"), Quiet Hours, and reflective prompts that **encourage mindful scrolling**, reduce impulsivity, and give users more control over their time.
