# Buddy Check

Welcome to **Buddy Check** — a CS 410/411W project focused on reducing screen addiction through mindful app usage and user reflection.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Despite widespread awareness of the negative impacts of excessive screen use on productivity, mental health, and sleep, most people still struggle to implement lasting behavioral changes.  
The convenience and design of modern digital platforms promote **habitual doomscrolling**, making it difficult for individuals to break the cycle without external support or intentional intervention.

## 💡 Solution Statement

**Buddy Check** is a multi-platform, behavioral tool designed to help people **build healthier screen habits** without giving up social media entirely.  
It introduces features like time-limited access ("Air Tanks"), Quiet Hours, and reflective prompts that **encourage mindful scrolling**, reduce impulsivity, and give users more control over their time.
